This report analyzes the impact of physicochemical properties on wine grades by examining the association
between the properties and the wine flavor scores. To explore the relationship, a proportional odds model
was used in this article. The data used in this paper was created by Cortez et al. (1998). It includes two
datasets related to red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine.
